mathdoku
========

MathDoku is an Android app for playing KenKen puzzles. It is a fork of the MathDoku app (version 1.96). Compared to the original MathDoku, it includes a brand new user interface, statistics, archive and a sharing function.


Important notice: It has been several years since I have worked on this code. Also my git skills were not very well developed at that time. As far as I can remember the branch 595 should be the code that reflects the app as it is currently published on the Google Playstore. Most likely the master branch will not work succesfully and/or contain a lot of bugs (I know that I was halfway between some big refactoring but I can not recall the status).
