#
# File is set to READ ONLY as the file generated by Android Studio refers to the wrong SDK path.
# Although this causes two warnings when starting the IDE it is easier than replacing the file 
# each time by a correct copy.
#
# This problem should be fixed in AS 0.3.7 or above.
#

# The local.properties file generated by Android Studio 0.3.2 is not consistent
# with ANDROID_HOME which results in different Gradle builds in AS versus
# command line. This should have been solved in AS 0.3.7 but this is not 
# verified yet.
