Sonar rules below are excluded for given reasons:

1) Tabulation characters should not be used
   Currently this is a one man project.

2 )Constructor Calls Overridable Method
   Declaring methods called from constructor as final would resolve this problem. But if such is
   done, the unit tests will fail as Mockito cannot handle final methods.

3) Insufficient branch coverage by unit tests
   Code coverage for Android using Sonar/Gradle does not yet work.
